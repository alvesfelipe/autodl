"""An example of code submission for the AutoDL challenge.

It implements 3 compulsory methods ('__init__', 'train' and 'test') and
an attribute 'done_training' for indicating if the model will not proceed more
training due to convergence or limited time budget.

To create a valid submission, zip model.py together with other necessary files
such as Python modules/packages, pre-trained weights, etc. The final zip file
should not exceed 300MB.

    This method will be called REPEATEDLY during the whole training/predicting
    process. So your `train` method should be able to handle repeated calls and
    hopefully improve your model performance after each call.

    Args:
      dataset: a `tf.data.Dataset` object. Each of its examples is of the form
            (example, labels)
          where `example` is a dense 4-D Tensor of shape
            (sequence_size, row_count, col_count, num_channels)
          and `labels` is a 1-D Tensor of shape
            (output_dim,).
          Here `output_dim` represents number of classes of this
          multilabel classification task.

          IMPORTANT: some of the dimensions of `example` might be `None`,
          which means the shape on this dimension might be variable. In this
          case, some preprocessing technique should be applied in order to
          feed the training of a neural network. For example, if an image
          dataset has `example` of shape
            (1, None, None, 3)
          then the images in this datasets may have different sizes. On could
          apply resizing, cropping or padding in order to have a fixed size
          input tensor.

      remaining_time_budget: a float, time remaining to execute train(). The method
          should keep track of its execution time to avoid exceeding its time
          budget. If remaining_time_budget is None, no time budget is imposed.

          set and `output_dim` is the number of labels to be predicted. The
          values should be binary or in the interval [0,1].

          IMPORTANT: if returns `None`, this means that the algorithm
          chooses to stop training, and the whole train/test will stop. The
